When I applied numba (via @jit) to the numpy_integrate function, x^2 was numerically integrated over 0 to 1 with N=100k in about 0.0013 seconds. This is an improvement over the time that it took both the integrator program and the numpy integrator program (about 0.023 seconds, and about 0.0027 seconds respectively). This calculation was done in about half of the time it took numpy to do the same calculation.

According to:https://numba.pydata.org/, "Numba supports compilation of Python to run on either CPU or GPU hardware, and is designed to integrate with the Python scientific software stack". This means that it is conventient to use Numba if one potentially wants to use a Graphics Processing Unit toether with a CPU to accelerate the computations. Numba also has the advantage of being designed to integrate with the Python scientific software stack.

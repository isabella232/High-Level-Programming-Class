The time that it took the integrator program to numerically integrate x^2 over 0 to 1 using an N of 100k was about 0.023 seconds. By using Numpy arrays, the time that it took the numpy_integrator program to numerically integrate x^2 over 0 to 1 using an N of 100k was only about 0.0027 seconds. The numpy integrator program worked 8.5 times faster, almost an order of magnitude faster.

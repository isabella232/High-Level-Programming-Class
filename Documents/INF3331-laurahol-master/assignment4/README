-For some reason, I cannot download matplotlib onto my computer. Pip cannot properly install tkinter, which is a required library. However, I understand how to produce plots with matplotlib as discussed in class, and so to satisfy 4.2 I wrote code that plots error as a function of n that would work if it wasn't commented out and matplotlib was installed. I created the requested plot with openoffice, and I'm hoping that this is OK as 4.2 does not specify how the plot must be created.

-I was not entirely sure how to create a package for 4.7. For this reason, I uploaded all of my files in the Assignment 4 directory in my github account. I also uploaded the Assignment 4 Package that I attempted to create, but if it doesn't work, the grader can simply refer to the files that are in the Assignment 4 folder.
